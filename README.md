# Path-Finding-Algorithm

This repository contains implementations of various path-finding algorithms using PyGame. The algorithms are designed to demonstrate different approaches to finding the shortest path in a grid-based environment.

## Features

- Visual representation of different path-finding algorithms
- Interactive grid for adding obstacles and setting start/end points
- Comparison of algorithm efficiency and performance

## Algorithms Implemented

- A* (A-star)
- Bellman-Ford
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Dijkstra

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml)


## Usage

1. **Run the main script:**

    ```sh
    python main.py -[algorithm]
    ```

2. **Use the interactive grid to set the start point, end point, and obstacles.**
